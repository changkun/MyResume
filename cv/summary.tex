    I'm a B.E. student in Computer Science at Southwest University for Nationalities, and I'm also a exchange student in Media Computer Science at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München major in Human-Computer Interaction course.
    I have a deep interest in Intelligent System combines Human-Computer Interaction and Large-scale Machine Learning. I enjoy programming in Objective-C/Swift for quickly product prototyping and development. Besides, I love mathematics and learned by myself in Mathematical Analysis and Abstract Algebra when I was in middle school.
