\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

Changkun Ou is a research assistant at the University of Munich. His research topics are interdisciplinary in 
computational geometry, imitation learning, and human-computer interaction. In particular, 
he would like to leverage three-dimensional polygonal mesh representation learning 
and visual preference elicitation to develop efficient algorithms or industrial tools 
for 3D modeling and rendering.
