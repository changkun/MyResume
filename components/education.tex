    % brings neural networks in learning the latent representation of three-dimensional polygonal mesh, 
    % models visual preference elicitation process to understand user behavior in 3D modeling,
    % and develops efficient algorithms or industrial tools for real-time 3D rendering.}

    % \emph{
    %   I decided to do my master degree in HCI because I believe building great products 
    %   requires not only technical details but also a higher-level understanding of humanity. 
    %   The degree extends my understanding of how to modeling user behavior and 
    %   how to design proper user studies for investigating product issues. 
    %   Beyond doing compulsory HCI courses, 
    %   I also participated most of my course in machine learning and high-performance parallel 
    %   and distributed computing related fields, 
    %   and therefore I was part-time hired as a student tutor in machine learning 
    %   and deep learning lectures because of my excellent grades.

      \emph{Understanding and Predicting Web Browsing Behavior}. 
      % The thesis proposed a sequence to sequence machine learning model that studied 
      % the modeling ability of web browsing behavior. 
      % The proposed model involves not only server-side recorded requests, 
      % but also integrates client-side browser multi-tab branching, backtrack viewing, 
      % and stay the duration of users. 
      % Experiments and analysis result shows the model suggests client-side modeling of 
      % browsing data is better for classification and prediction of userâ€™s web browsing behaviors.

      %   During my bachelor studies, 
      %   I spent my time exploring many different computer science areas. 
      %   For instance, I wrote a tiny compiler when I was studying compilation theory.
